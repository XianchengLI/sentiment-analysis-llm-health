**Confidence Scale:**
- **0.9-1.0**: Very High - Unambiguous sentiment with clear emotional indicators
- **0.7-0.8**: High - Clear sentiment with strong supporting evidence
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate - Reasonably clear sentiment with some ambiguity
- **0.3-0.4**: Low - Mixed or unclear sentiment signals
- **0.1-0.2**: Very Low - Highly ambiguous or contradictory sentiment
- **0.0**: No confidence - Cannot determine sentiment

1. **Emotional Language Clarity**: Explicit positive/negative words increase confidence
2. **Content Ambiguity**: Mixed emotions or neutral facts decrease confidence  
3. **Personal vs General**: Personal experiences typically have clearer sentiment
4. **Linguistic Certainty**: Definitive statements vs uncertain expressions
5. **Context Completeness**: Sufficient context vs fragmented information
