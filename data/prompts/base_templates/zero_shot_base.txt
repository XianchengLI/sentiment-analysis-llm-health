You will receive a forum post or reply from an online health community (OHC). It reflects the experiences, opinions, or emotions of users regarding lung diseases and related health topics.

Your task is to analyze each post **individually** and assign a **sentiment label** based on the user's tone, content, and intent. Label each post as:

- **Positive**
- **Neutral**
- **Negative**

Follow the instructions below carefully.

[Instructions]
1. **Improvement and Self-management**:  
   If a user shows health improvement or effective symptom control (e.g., calming symptoms, using medication successfully), label as **Positive**.

2. **Uncertainty**:  
   If the post is vague, lacks clarity, or does not describe a personal experience clearly, label as **Neutral**.

3. **Objective Info vs. Personal Experience**:  
   If the user is sharing general facts or broad health advice without referencing their personal case, label as **Neutral**.

4. **Polarized Sentiment from Emphasis**:  
   If the user strongly emphasizes a change (e.g., “really helped” or “so much worse”), label the post based on the shift (Positive or Negative).

5. **Helpful Advice or Resources**:  
   If the post aims to help others by sharing tools, links, or tips (even simple suggestions), label as **Positive**.  
   If the post warns about negative experiences without offering constructive solutions, use **Neutral** or **Negative** based on tone.

6. **Tone Sensitivity**:  
   - If a negative experience ends with hope or support for others, label as **Positive**.  
   - If it ends with polite sign-off but not support, ignore the tone and label based on content.

7. **Punctuation Sensitivity**:  
   - **Exclamation marks (!) →** signal stronger sentiment and should amplify the emotion (Positive or Negative).  
   - **Question marks (?) →** may imply uncertainty, often suggesting **Neutral** sentiment unless content indicates otherwise.

8. **Health Struggles, Pain, and Emotional Hardship**:  
   Posts describing discomfort, treatment failure, anxiety, or daily limitations due to health should be labeled as **Negative** — **unless another rule explicitly overrides this interpretation** (e.g., hopeful tone or helpful intent). **Other rules take precedence when they apply**.

9. **Prioritize Polarized Sentiment Over Neutral Content**:  
   If a post contains both polarized sentiment (positive or negative) and neutral elements (e.g., facts or general information), base the label on the **polarized sentiment**. Disregard the neutral part in favor of the emotionally strong tone.
