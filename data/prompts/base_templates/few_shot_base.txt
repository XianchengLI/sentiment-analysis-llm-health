You will receive a forum post or reply from an online health community (OHC). It reflects the experiences, opinions, or emotions of users regarding lung diseases and related health topics.

Your task is to analyze each post **individually** and assign a **sentiment label** based on the user's tone, content, and intent. Label each post as:

- **Positive**
- **Neutral**
- **Negative**

Follow the instructions below carefully.

[Instructions]
1. **Improvement and Self-management**:  
   If a user shows health improvement or effective symptom control (e.g., calming symptoms, using medication successfully), label as **Positive**.

2. **Uncertainty**:  
   If the post is vague, lacks clarity, or does not describe a personal experience clearly, label as **Neutral**.

3. **Objective Info vs. Personal Experience**:  
   If the user is sharing general facts or broad health advice without referencing their personal case, label as **Neutral**.

4. **Polarized Sentiment from Emphasis**:  
   If the user strongly emphasizes a change (e.g., “really helped” or “so much worse”), label the post based on the shift (Positive or Negative).

5. **Helpful Advice or Resources**:  
   If the post aims to help others by sharing tools, links, or tips (even simple suggestions), label as **Positive**.  
   If the post warns about negative experiences without offering constructive solutions, use **Neutral** or **Negative** based on tone.

6. **Tone Sensitivity**:  
   - If a negative experience ends with hope or support for others, label as **Positive**.  
   - If it ends with polite sign-off but not support, ignore the tone and label based on content.

7. **Punctuation Sensitivity**:  
   - **Exclamation marks (!) →** signal stronger sentiment and should amplify the emotion (Positive or Negative).  
   - **Question marks (?) →** may imply uncertainty, often suggesting **Neutral** sentiment unless content indicates otherwise.

8. **Health Struggles, Pain, and Emotional Hardship**:  
   Posts describing discomfort, treatment failure, anxiety, or daily limitations due to health should be labeled as **Negative** — **unless another rule explicitly overrides this interpretation** (e.g., hopeful tone or helpful intent). **Other rules take precedence when they apply**.

9. **Prioritize Polarized Sentiment Over Neutral Content**:  
   If a post contains both polarized sentiment (positive or negative) and neutral elements (e.g., facts or general information), base the label on the **polarized sentiment**. Disregard the neutral part in favor of the emotionally strong tone.

[Examples]
Note: **Avoid labeling a post as Neutral unless it is clearly vague, impersonal, or uncertain**. If the post shows any emotional tone, helpful advice, or health experience (positive or negative), label accordingly.

# Rule: Improvement and Self-management
Post: "I thought I'd need help last night, but I managed to calm my breathing down."  
Label: Positive

# Rule: Uncertainty
Post: "There was a fuss about the drug about ten years ago and I am not sure how widely it is now used but I had it a few times, I think it was before I started taking Prednisolone more regularly. Sorry but as it was so long ago I cannot remember the side effects but I know there was something that went wrong."  
Label: Neutral

# Rule: Objective Info vs. Personal Experience
Post: "It does not cause Asthma, but makes the existing symptoms worse, so anything we can do to reduce stress, anxiety, depression is a good thing. Unfortunately long-term health conditions such as Asthma do tend to come with anxiety."  
Label: Neutral

# Rule: Polarized Sentiment from Emphasis
Post: "My main concern was (still is) that the steroid component of Fostair is Beclometasone. I've been on that steroid before and my asthma was never properly controlled while I was on it. The fluticasone has really been so much more effective."  
Label: Positive

# Rule: Helpful Advice or Resources
Post: “I was just going to say you can get them on Amazon. Www.powerbreathe.com has them too but it looks like they don't have the flutter. The flutter and the acapella are to help move mucus and are of a great help to people with Bronchiectasis. You can also find breathing exercises online on YouTube for the same purpose but without buying any device. Have a look on YouTube.”  
Label: Positive

# Rule: Helpful Advice or Resources (Warning without solution)
Post: "I do not want to make you all paranoid and suspicious but feel the need to warn everyone to be aware. While things are still new I think that we all need to be careful who we give our contact details to. This is a public forum and anyone can post. Last year we had some problems with people who posted many things that later proved to be untrue and it caused lots of bad feeling and upset."  
Label: Negative

# Rule: Health Struggles, Pain, and Emotional Hardship
Post: "The medication isn’t working as expected, and I feel worse than before! I can’t do anything without feeling breathless, and I feel like my life is on hold."  
Label: Negative

# Rule: Tone Sensitivity
Post: "I'm still awake thanks to lungs throwing a major strop and landing me in A&E earlier this evening. Hope you are all managing to sleep well"  
Label: Positive

# Rule: Tone Sensitivity (Polite closing only)
Post: "I’ve had a tough night with my asthma, can’t seem to catch a break. I’ll let you know if it improves. Take care."  
Label: Negative

# Rule: Punctuation Sensitivity (Exclamation)
Post: "Wish I could sleep, but my lungs have other ideas again!”  
Label: Negative

# Rule: Tone outweighs unclear content
Post: "Not sure if this helps, but I used a vaporizer and felt a bit better after. Hang in there!"
Label: Positive
